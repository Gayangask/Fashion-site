                <h4><dl>How do I cancel or change my order?</dl></h4>
                <dd>As soon as you place your order, we begin processing it.
                     Therefore, we are unable to change or cancel orders.
                      Please visit the returns page if you wish to submit
                       a return authorization once your order has been received.
                        The terms and conditions for returns will apply.</dd>


                        <h4><dl>How do I take advantage of bulk discounting?</dl></h4>
                        <dd>To deliver the most competitive, every day low prices to our customers, we now offer reduced prices on eligible sale items automatically, regardless of cart size. Sale prices are displayed directly on the product pages and notated in blue.

                            Buy more, save more is still our motto! Eligible bulk orders $80 and up are still automatically discounted in cart. Unlike before, sale items may actually be eligible for additional bulk discounts, but at a maximum rate that factors in any reduced pricing that has already been applied. Closeout prices are notated in red on product pages, are not eligible for additional bulk discounts, and are final sale. Please note, all Richardson products are excluded from all discounts and promotions, including promo codes and bulk discounts.

                                    For Faster or Fastest shipping, our Expedited shipping rates vary based on weight, mailing address, desired delivery date. Please note, while most packages do arrive within 1-2 business days of the estimated 'faster/fastest' delivery date, we do not guarantee delivery on the estimated date shown during checkout.
                                    
                                    All orders placed before 11 AM PST, will ship out the same day, any order placed after will ship the following business day.

                                    Products from the same order are often shipped from different warehouses. This does not affect your shipping cost but may require the order to be delivered in multiple packages and the shipping time may vary. You can also check the status of your order by logging into your account.
